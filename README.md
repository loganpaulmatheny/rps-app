### Learning Goals

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins

- Finished project ahead of schedule and spent time refactoring as well as updating CSS layout
- Minimized

### Challenges

- Attempts to 'stop' function calls until prior function is complete (JS is an asynchronous language and this is not possible)
